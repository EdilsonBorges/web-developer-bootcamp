# JavaScript Object Notation

# Easy to read and write
# Often used with AJAX
# Can be used with most modern languages

Data Types
----------

# Number: No difference between integer and floats
# String: String of Unicode characters. Use double quotes
# Boolean: True or false
# Array: Ordered list of 0 or more values
# Object: Unordered collection of key/value pairs
# Null: Empty value

Rules
-----

# Uses key/value pairs - {"name":"Ed"}
# Uses double quotes around KEY and VALUE
# Must use the specified data type
# File type is ".json"
# MIME type is "Application/json"
	MIME type (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is the mechanism to tell the client the variety of document transmitted: the extension of a file name has no meaning on the web.
