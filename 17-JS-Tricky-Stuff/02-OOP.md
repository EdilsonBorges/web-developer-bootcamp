- Define Object Oriented Programming
    - A programming model based around the idea of objects
    - These objects are constructed from what are called "classes", which we can think of like a blueprint. We call these objects created from classes "instances"
    - We strive to make our classes abstract and modular
- Revisit 'new' keyword
- Use constructor
- Use call and apply
